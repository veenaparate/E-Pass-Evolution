Once registered, users can log in to their accounts to view, update, or renew their bus passes as needed.On the administrative side, authorized personnel have access to a secure dashboard where they can manage user accounts, process pass registrations and renewals, generate reports, and monitor overall system performance. The backend is powered by PHP scripts that handle user authentication, data validation, database interactions.The MySQL database stores user account information, pass details, transaction records, and other relevant data in a structured manner.
